# PRODIGY_DS_01
## Adult Income Dataset Analysis
### Project Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Adult Income dataset to visualize the relationships between various demographic and socioeconomic variables. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant data. The project uses a combination of histograms, bar charts, and categorical plots to visualize the distribution of variables such as age, sex, workclass, occupation, education, capital gain, capital loss, and hours worked per week. The relationships between these variables are also explored, including the impact of sex on these relationships.
### Dataset
The Adult Income dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains demographic and socioeconomic information about individuals in the United States. The dataset consists of 32,561 samples and 15 features, including age, workclass, education, occupation, capital gain, capital loss, hours worked per week, and others.
